        <p>this is a list of things to do while resting:</p>
        <ul>        
            <li>sit or stand</li>
            <li>read a book</li>
            <li>think</li>
            <li>not think</li>
        </ul>
        <p>here's the same list, but arbitrarily ordered:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>sit or stand</li>
            <li>think</li>
            <li>not think</li>

        <p>In our lives and as part of organizations, workplaces and movements, many of us <i>play different roles</i> in pursuit of equity, shared liberation, inclusion, and justice. And yet, we often get overwhelmed, lost, and burned out. Some of us are newcomers to ongoing social change efforts and don’t know where to start. Still others are catalyzed into action in the midst of a crisis in our community.

        The <b>Social Change Ecosystem Map</b> is a framework that can help individuals, networks, and organizations align with social change values, individual roles, and the broader ecosystem. What you’re reading now is the most recent version of the social change ecosystem framework created by Deepa Iyer (BMP’s Senior Director of Strategic Initiatives). Deepa first developed the map in 2018, and this 2020 version incorporates her new and revised text.</p>
